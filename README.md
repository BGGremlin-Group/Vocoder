## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: Windows 11
- **Hardware**: Microphone, speakers, and webcam (for live facial animation)
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Disk Space**: ~500 MB for dependencies and assets

### Installation
1. **Clone or Download**:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/bggg_vocoder.git](https://github.com/BGGremlin-Group/Vocoder.git/
   cd Vocoder
   ```
   Or download `bggg_vocoder_v5_0.py` from the releases page.

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python bggg_vocoder_v5_0.py
   ```
   The script automatically installs dependencies (`pyaudio`, `numpy`, `torch`, `speechbrain`, `trimesh`, `webrtcvad`, etc.) and downloads required assets (e.g., `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`).

3. **Directory Structure**:
   - `~/BGGG_Vocoder/assets`: Stores logo, credits, exit screens, static visualizer, and dlib shape predictor.
   - `~/BGGG_Vocoder/config`: Stores `config.json` for settings.
   - `~/BGGG_Vocoder/recordings`: Saves WAV and MP4 outputs.
   - `~/BGGG_Vocoder/voice_models`: Stores trained voice models (`.pth`).
   - `~/BGGG_Vocoder/presets`: Stores preset configurations.
   - `~/BGGG_Vocoder/themes`: Stores web UI template (`web_ui.html`).
   - `~/BGGG_Vocoder/docs`: Stores user manual (`user_manual.html`).

### Usage
1. **Launch the App**:
   - The app starts with a logo screen (3s), followed by credits (3s), then opens the retro Winamp-style interface.

2. **Configure Settings**:
   - Select a vocoder algorithm (Phase, LPC, Channel) via the control panel.
   - Choose a visualization mode (Spectrogram, 3D Waterfall, etc.) via the main settings tab.
   - Enable simplified mode to hide advanced settings for a retro experience.
   - Adjust pitch, modulation depth, modulation rate, volume, particle count, and particle size using sliders.
   - Upload a selfie or enable webcam for facial animation.
   - Train a voice model via "Train Voice" (record 10+ seconds) or "Import Voice" (MP3/MP4).
   - Enter text in the TTS input field for real-time text-to-speech.
   - Select animation mode (Face Only, Full Body, Particles) and load OBJ files for full-body animation.

3. **Process Audio**:
   - Click "‚ñ∂ Play" for real-time effects.
   - Use "‚óè Rec" to capture audio and animations.
   - Import MP3/WAV/MP4 files via "Batch Process" in the main settings tab.
   - Export recordings as WAV or MP4 (video+audio) via "üíæ Save".

4. **Visualize and Animate**:
   - Watch real-time visualizations (equalizer or spectrum) in the main panel.
   - Enable "Animate Face" for lip-sync with selfie/webcam.
   - Select "Full Body" for 3D OBJ model animation or "Particles" for audio-reactive particle effects.

5. **Access Web UI**:
   - Click "Launch Web UI" to open `http://localhost:5000` for remote control.

6. **Access Help**:
   - Click "Help" for the local user manual or "Online Help" for the GitHub repository.

### Example Workflow
- **Create a Cloned Voice Video with Live TTS**:
  1. Upload a selfie or enable webcam.
  2. Train a voice model with a 10+ second MP3 file or live recording.
  3. Enter text in the TTS input field (e.g., "Hello, this is my digital clone!").
  4. Enable "Use Cloned Voice" and "Animate Face" (Face Only mode).
  5. Start recording with "‚óè Rec", then export as MP4 to get a video with your cloned voice and lip-synced animation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- **Audio Issues**: Ensure microphone/speakers are configured in Windows 11 settings. Check audio device selection in the GUI.
- **Webcam Issues**: Verify webcam permissions and lighting. Select the correct webcam device in the GUI.
- **Voice Cloning**: Use clear audio samples (minimal background noise) for best results.
- **Performance**: Enable "Low Performance Mode" or increase buffer size if latency occurs. Adjust chunk size dynamically via system load monitoring.
- **Errors**: Check the status display (bottom of GUI) or `vocoder.log` for detailed error messages.
- **OBJ Models**: Ensure OBJ files are valid and placed in the `assets` directory for full-body animation.
